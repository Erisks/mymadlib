We have flower with our souls 
and read with our minds 
but you don't run see me now 
you're a little bit city 

yet you demand my pineapple 
and I'm into dogs 
but you must fart 
I'm not smiling these doors 

It's nice to know 
I study you around 
But the cup is pretty 
until the butterfly can be dinasour
